    "bio":"I am a translational neuroscientist focused on using machine learning tools to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks and to develop clinically viable neurotechnologies aimed at improving the clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychological disorders, such as PTSD and concussion. To accelerate the conception and development of such novel translational neurotechnologies, I co-founded NeurotechHA, the Hamilton chapter of the global NeurotechX organization, with the objective of unifying interdisciplinary researchers, industry partners and clinicians with a common interest in applying neurotechnologies to improve health outcomes.",
    "bio_current":"I am currently a MITACS post-doctoral fellow at the Homewood Research Institute (HRI), and the Department of Psychiatry at Western University, under the supervision of Dr. Ruth Lanius, where I am applying my machine learning (ML) and artifical intelligence (AI) expertise to translate research-findings into clinical neuromarkers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), aiming to improve diagnosis and treatment of such psychological disorders. I also am a postgraduate affiliate of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Toronto.",
	"bio_past":"I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Sue Becker at McMaster University, where my work focused on identifying signatures of brain networks using a cheaper and more clinically feasible imaging modality (EEG), compared to the current norm (fMRI), for better diagnosis of patients with complex mental health disorders (e.g. PTSD). I also completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering from McMaster University, while developing better treatment tracking tools for concussion, and applying machine learning to improveme medical imaging of muscle.
