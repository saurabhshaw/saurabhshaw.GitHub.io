    "bio":"I am a translational neuroscientist focused on using machine learning (ML) and artifical intelligence (AI) tools to better understand the brain and to develop clinically viable neurotechnologies aimed at improving the clinical diagnosis/treatment of neurological and psychological disorders (such as PTSD and concussion), and enabling better quality-of-life for vulnerable populations (e.g. Indigenous communities, youth, etc.). To accelerate the conception and development of such novel translational neurotechnologies, I co-founded NeurotechHA, the Hamilton chapter of the global NeurotechX organization, with the objective of unifying interdisciplinary researchers, industry partners and clinicians with a common interest in applying neurotechnologies to improve health outcomes.",
    "bio_current":"I am currently an Adjunct Research Professor at the Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at Western University, where I further my quest into AI-powered neuroscience and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for improved quality-of-life and better mental health. Most recently, I held the position of Senior Data Scientist at Cognixion Inc., where my work focused on developing a viable communicative BCI in Augmented Reality (AR) for those with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), running a host of research studies to understand the dynamics of selective attention and factors affecting BCI performance, and finally customizing the AI models to account for these factors.",
	"bio_past":"I completed a MITACS Industrial post-doctoral fellowship at the Homewood Research Institute (HRI), and the Department of Psychiatry at Western University, under the supervision of Dr. Ruth Lanius, where I applied my machine learning (ML) and artifical intelligence (AI) expertise to translate research-findings into clinical neuromarkers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to improve diagnosis and treatment of such psychological disorders. I also was a postgraduate affiliate of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Toronto. I acquired my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Sue Becker at McMaster University, where my work focused on identifying signatures of brain networks using a cheaper and more clinically feasible imaging modality (EEG), compared to the current norm (fMRI), for better diagnosis of patients with complex mental health disorders (e.g. PTSD). I also completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering from McMaster University, while developing better treatment tracking tools for concussion, and applying machine learning to improveme medical imaging of muscle.

Of these, three networks are of particular interest - the central executive network (CEN) responsible for external executive functioning; default mode network (DMN) involved in autobiographical memory and rumination; and the salience network (SN) which modulates switching attention between the CEN and the DMN.",

        "category":"A popular EEG-based method of describing brain dynamics, microstate analysis, describes EEG activity in terms of four or more discrete quasi-stable states. In doing so, it makes some key assumptions which have not been rigorously scrutinized. This was examined using dynamical systems analyses that assessed the chaotic and spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG data. It was found that microstates are inadequate for describing short-scale dynamics, although it might have some merit in capturing long-range dependencies.",

        "category":"Identifying EEG descriptors that can detect activity of the large scale brain networks requires the use of a wide range of machine learning methods - from feature engineering that finds the appropriate features for this task, to classifiers that attempt to identify the active brain network using these features. This results in a tool that can look at a section of EEG and separate the activity of each network. This is illustrated in the picture shown below, where different colors indicate the different networks that have been separated into independent clusters.",

With approximately one in ten Canadians developing PTSD in their lifetime, this country has one of the highest rates of PTSD among developed nations. Thus, it is essential to identify tools that can be used to efficiently and effectively diagnose and treat debilitating psychopathologies such as PTSD. I am working towards creating such diagnostic tools for brain health by using electroencephalography (EEG) to detect large-scale brain networks.",
